        <p id="ab">A Decade and Nine, that is the years that had gone by since I lived in this action-packed world at
            that moment, my teenaged parents thought of the idea to give me their names, Abigail (Mother) Dennis
            (Father). That is why here I am, Dennisse Gail Raflores Francisco, a college student taking up bachelor of
            Science and technology. I am currently living with my grandparents in Pinaod San Ildefonso Bulacan.
            <br>
            Most of that people that I have shared this to found it crazy or unusual, I entered and transferred to 9
            schools since day care. I joined day care when I was 3, the day care that I went to was literally our
            neighbor at our abode in Caloocan City. My mother told me that it wasn't hard for her to leave me at school
            because of that. Every time the class ends, I would shout at the school fence " The class is over, please
            fetch me!" I was 4 when I transferred to where I graduated kindergarten, Manila Central University (MCU).
            After 2 years of staying there my parents decided to transfer me to a new school which they think is a
            better school for me to start my elementary years, St. Mary's Academy of Caloocan City. When grade 1 started
            I was still having a hard time to read. Which was a challenge for me because our school is expecting that
            all the students already mastered reading. I remember answer the exam without reading the question because I
            can't understand it. As you can notice I wasn't the kid that was advanced and always excel in academics.
            With this reason my parents enrolled me to a tutor they found in front of my school to help me improve my
            reading and writing skills. Even I was a kid I was eager to learn and improve myself. Fortunately, as the
            next school year started I already know how to read not perfectly but enough for a grade 2 student to help
            her pass.
            It was a good start for the school year, I thought that nothing would go wrong little do I know that the
            biggest plot twist of our family will betide. My parents separated when I was in grade 2. I remember crying
            at night and going to school in the morning. This is also where they decided to sell our house in Caloocan.
            My father went to Bulacan to stay at his parents’ house. As for me, my 2-year-old brother and my Mom stayed
            at her parents’ house in Navotas city. I had no choice but to stay in manila to finish the school year. My
            uncle used to fetch me using his motorcycle. Every day I would travel more than 30 mins to go to school. I
            did not know how but I passed all my subjects and survive that chaotic school year. After that, each of my
            parents went to me and "ask where do you want to stay?". That was the most heartbreaking and hardest
            decision a daughter had make. I listed down the pros and cons of me staying with my mom or dad. It was hard
            to choose although I needed to decide and I chose to stay with my father.
            <br>
            The next school year started, I stayed in Bulacan. I attended my 4th school, St. John School. I studied
            there for 3 years. It was smooth sailing as I start to accept the challenge we went through; I was always on
            top of the class. On my last year, grade 5 I got bullied. I was verbally and cyber bullied by one of my
            classmates. I stood up and told the teacher what was happening but their answers were all the same that they
            will discipline the student. Although nothing changed, I've come to the point where I realized that I had
            enough and decided to transfer to a new school the next year and try staying with my mom.
            <br>
            Grade 6, I transferred to a public school in Navotas so that I can experience what it was like. It was an
            experience, as it was a new environment for me. I was part of section A, the top section, they said that it
            was not as chaotic like other sections. One of the things that I remember was during break time. One to two
            class representative will go to the canteen and get a basket filled with food and that representatives will
            be selling it. Attending this school made me realize how hard life was. That's the world is really unfair. I
            graduated not only learning academically but also with life lessons that I treasure for a life time.
            High school, my last school only caters until grade 6 so I needed to transfer school again. I've talked to
            my parents and asked if I can attend to a private school. It had a good experience in public school but
            their teaching style was not for me. I transferred to my 6th school San Jose Academy. In this school, I've
            gained my confidence in speaking and improve speaking in English. My thinking also enchanted critically
            because at that young age we already have investigatory projects. After that school year my father asked me
            if I can stay with him because my brother is still under 7 his custody is still under my mom. I agreed with
            my father’s idea and went back to Bulacan.<br>
            We are now on the second to the last school I attended before the university I am attending as of now.
            Goldenville School Of Montessori, where I have experience a lot of things. I studied there for the rest of
            Junior High School that's when pandemic started. We were about to practice for our moving up but classes got
            suspended for 2 weeks and you know what happened it lasted for 2 years. That's why our moving up was held
            thru online.
            I was supposed to attend senior high school in Manila but because of the pandemic I did not push thru.
            Rather I enrolled in Baliuag University. Before going to senior high school I decided that I’ll be taking
            the medicine filed for college but look at me now doing a Website for my final project for an information
            technology major subject. Senior high school made me realize that medicine field was not for me and take my
            passion for editing into consideration. I finished senior high school thru synchronous classes and
            fortunately we got a face to face graduation.
            As college days was about to start, pressure also started to build up as I did not know what to expect. I
            was also enrolled in Lithan a program offered in Baliuag University that is based on Singapore. Where we
            will be undertaking software engineering courses for a year and the rest is or college years is
            apprenticeship. I only took this course for more than a week and my mind and body gave up. Probably because
            it was still online class and I was so fed up with online classes during senior high school. With that I
            shifted to regular Information Technology that Baliuag University offers. I can say that was the best
            decision I made I am now happy and enjoying my course while performing my full potential.
